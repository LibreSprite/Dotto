# LibreSprite Dotto!

## Funding / Contributing

For the time being, this project is fuelled purely by the power of the **stars**.
As in, github stars.
We use them to light and heat the crates we keep our codegnomes in. As of this
writing, the repo has 21 stars to its 390 commits, so we still have plenty of
gnomes coding in cold, dark crates, which is a problem in the winter.
Since they don't want to freeze their little gnomefingers off, the exchange
rate is currently set to *5 commits per star*.

So, if you want to contribute to the project but don't know how to code, feel
free to give the repo a star. *Think of the codegnomes.*
